					<h2>What Is A Drag King?</h2>
					<p>A drag king is most often defined as a female-bodied person who performs an interpretation of masculinty in front of an audience in a variety of ways including: lip-syncing, live singing, stand-up, emceeing and sideshow.</p>

<p>There is no right or wrong way to be a drag king. Masculinity can be interpreted, and therefore performed, differently from king to king. We highly encourage new performers to experiment with what masculinity means to them and how they would like the audience to be affected by their performance.</p>
